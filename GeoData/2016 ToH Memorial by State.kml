It is located high on a hill (see note below) along the Coosa River. Hidden behind one of the park buildings, it is a little hard to see from the street but well maintained and the inscriptions are good reading. The parking lot is gravel, but hard-packed. The sidewalk to the memorial itself poses no ADA issues.<br><br>Made in America: As you leave the parking lot, the impressive rise just ahead of you is the result of a meteor strike 85 million years ago. “Wetumpka is the site of the only authenticated impact crater in the eastern United States and one of only 200 craters worldwide.” It is theorized that the impact threw debris all the way to the Gulf of Mexico. Bald Knob (where all the radio and TV towers are) is the highest point on the rim. There is a road to the top, but not for the feint of heart or inexperienced rider. (GPS: 32.531958, -86.192878)]]></description>

Originally, the tablet listed the names divided by race, but in 2002 it was replaced by one that made no distinction. The original tablet is now located two blocks away at the Clarke County Historical Museum. The unusual location and configuration of the monument is due to the fact that it was constructed above an early-1900’s well that serviced the courthouse.]]></description>

The monument was originally planned in remembrance of Vietnam aviators, but has since become a tribute to all aviators who serve and protect the United States. <br><br>Military clothing items were sent to the artist in Italy for accuracy as the statue was carved from a single block of marble. Capt. Jerry Stripling of the nearby Army Aviation Center was chosen as the model. <br><br>The monument was actually carved twice after breaking on its first trip from Italy.<br><br>Made in America: If your routing is along US84 through Enterprise, you may see a sky full of low-flying army helicopters on training missions north of town, and the unique ‘Boll Weevil Monument’ in the downtown square. A nice monument to a cotton-eating bug….rather the conquering of a cotton-eating bug.]]></description>

He was chief engineer of the Alaska Railroad and served as Mayor of Anchorage, Alaska from 1956 to 1958. He has been called "Mr. Alaska Railroad."<br><br>In the 1930s, Anderson worked on the Matanuska Colonization Project, building Alaskan infrastructure to support the settlement of the Matanuska Valley. During World War II, he served in the United States Army Corps of Engineers. He also participated in the construction of the Eklutna River hydroelectric dam. <br><br>In 1976, the tunnel from Whittier to Portage, Alaska, which he had overseen, was renamed the Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel.<br><br>CAUTION: Before passing through the 2.5 mile tunnel (longest one-lane highway tunnel in North America), READ THE LINKS BELOW. This tunnel shares traffic with trains (though not at the same time). SLIPPERY WITH STRONG CROSSWINDS due to jet fans used for ventilation. If you’re uncomfortable with slippery bridge grating or crossing wet trolley tracks, you’ll likely be uncomfortable here (tip: keep bike centered between the rails, don't white knuckle the handlebars....relax) TUNNEL PASSAGE NOT MANDATORY for credit.<br><br>http://www.motoquest.com/blogs/2014-alaskan-anton-anderson-memorial-tunnel-blog-201<br><br>http://www.alaska.org/guide/portage-valley]]></description>

Herrera Way. As confusing as this seems, the road is named after PFC Silvestre Santana Herrera. In Mertzwiller, France during WWII, Herrera singlehandedly attacked an enemy stronghold, capturing eight enemy soldiers. Another enemy stronghold was attacking his unit from across a minefield. Even after losing both his legs below the knees he maintained cover fire allowing his unit to overrun the enemy from a flanking position. Herrera was the only living person allowed to simultaneously wear the Medal of Honor and his birth country’s (Mexico) Order of Military Merit.<br><br>We encourage all riders to stop and visit with veterans. Unfortunately, current security protocol do not allow non-relatives to visit residents of the home without staff supervision. If you want to pre-arrange a trip and possibly help with activities, you will be welcomed. Contact state sponsor Matthew Hogan for details if you want to arrange a visit. Otherwise, it is recommended that you take a card or note to show your appreciation for their service.]]></description>

More....<br><br>Yellville is named after Archibald Yell, who was the first member of the United States House of Representatives from Arkansas and the second Governor of Arkansas. He was killed at the Battle of Buena Vista during the Mexican-American War. Yellville existed well before Arkansas became a state, though originally known as Shawneetown.<br><br>Marion County was formed in 1836, shortly after statehood. Shawneetown was then renamed Yellville. An old tale claims Archibald Yell offered $50 to do so, but never paid the money. True or not, Governor Yell's descendants heard the story and paid the overdue "bill" several years ago. Yell's name can be seen elsewhere in the state, including Yell County, Arkansas and Archibald Yell Boulevard in Fayetteville, Arkansas.<br><br>Every year since 1946 the city of Yellville has celebrated what is known as Turkey Trot. Held on the second Friday and Saturday of October, the event was conceived as a way to call attention to the region's abundant wild turkeys. The event is held on the square in Yellville and has many things to offer for people of all ages. Craft vendors feature quilts, paintings, carvings, and homemade jams and jellies. You can find all kinds of shirts, hats and bags to take home as souvenirs, including official Turkey Trot t-shirts and buttons.<br><br>Nearby, another of Arkansas’ scenic roads known as the Push Mountain Road, AR-341, is a nice ride for motorcycles looking for a winding run. Push Mountain is composed of tight curves and knee-dragging stretches of pavement, as well as gorgeous scenery. Most road-savvy riders visiting the area will eventually find their way to AR 341. Its serpentine course winds up over the mountain and down into the White River Valley near Norfork on AR 5.]]></description>

It is reported to be approx. 2/3rds of it original size due to souvenir hunters chipping away at the stone until it was moved to its’ current location.<br><br>Several blocks east is the Black River Overlook. A life-size statue of Princess Pocahontas (the town’s namesake) stands near the entry to the park, in front of the pavilion. The princess has hair blowing in the wind and she clutches a stalk of the grain they lived on. For you history buffs, there is also River Walk Memorial Trail, a series of 6 historic markers established in 2006 along a paved trail. There’s a custom-made bench at each marker, featuring the outline of the cupola of the 1872 courthouse. The markers tell the story of Randolph County’s Civil War history in detail, including several major skirmishes in the county. Listed are all units, both Confederate and Union, stationed in the county, description of the capture of General Jeff Thompson, the 1863 burning of Pocahontas (the town) by Union forces, and many other significant events that occurred in Randolph County during the war.<br><br>NOTE: Let scorers know if you’d also like this site counted as a Doughboys destination.]]></description>

It was initially known as Turkey Flats and later Keller before being renamed by Judge Lawrence Alexander Byrne. Following his Keller mill being "burned down to ashes", Byrne vowed to rebuild and found a town named Ashdown. It was incorporated on June 11, 1892 as Ashdown, and rapid growth began in 1895 following the railroad reaching town. Its current population is approximately 4,600 residents. Ashdown is home to one of the largest paper mills of communication papers complexes in North America, and employs approximately 1,150 people. <br><br>The Two Rivers Museum at 15 E. Main Street contains a military display, "Freedom's Heroes", including World War I and World War II uniforms. If you find yourself heading this direction in May, be sure to check out the annual Whistlestop Festival in Downtown Ashdown. They pay homage to the importance of the railroad to the city's development. Festivities include an art show, catfish cook off, car show, food vendors, games/activities for children, turtle races and the crowning of Miss Whistlestop.]]></description>

The courthouse is of Victorian style and originally built in 1903 with its clock-tower bell marking hours. The public square has been a focal point of life in the town of Warren and the surrounding area for some 165 years. It became the seat of county government in 1842, two years after the state legislature created Bradley County in 1840. The county was named after Hugh Bradley, one of the founders of the Pennington Settlement. The first community to be established in the area by pioneers of European descent, the settlement was founded in 1825 at a site along the Saline River about six miles north of modern-day Warren. <br><br>Warren is also home of one of the oldest running festivals in the state. The Bradley County Pink Tomato Festival held the 2nd weekend of June every year. Organized by the local chamber of commerce, the pink tomato is Arkansas’ state fruit and vegetable.]]></description>

The resulting gush of population and prosperity led to an architectural boom still reflected in a self-guided walking tour of the city’s restored downtown, now filled with beautifully renovated 1930s style buildings and several historic buildings on the National Register. <br><br>Downtown is the historic heart of El Dorado, with dozens of shops, stores, restaurants, and nightlife options located near the stately 1928 Union County Courthouse.

During the war, he was the highest scoring ace in his P-51 Mustang squadron, the same squadron as well known test pilot (and first pilot to break the sound barrier) and ace Chuck Yeager, and they have remained lifelong close friends, both living in nearby Grass Valley. <br><br>Towards the end of Anderson's two combat tours in Europe in 1944 he was promoted to major at age 22, an extremely young age even for a highly effective officer in wartime. After the war Anderson became a well regarded fighter test pilot, and a fighter squadron and wing commander. <br><br>Bud also served a wing commander tour in combat in the Vietnam War, flying F-105s. He retired as a full colonel in 1972, after which he worked in flight test program for McDonnell Douglas. A member of the National Aviation Hall of Fame, Col.

He points out that five of the seven personnel listed on the memorial were motorcycle officers and he worked alongside two of them. Also, two of them are decorated war veterans, one a Purple Heart recipient (Vietnam), and another a WWII USAF officer shot down over Germany where he was a POW for nine months.<br><br>The detective adds, "... the most recent addition, killed less than a year ago, was chasing an armed felon who has since publicly stated he wanted to kill a police officer that night. The deceased officer, who had only 2 years of service, was not from Bakersfield, but chose to make it his home. Ultimately that decision cost him his life."]]></description>

This memorial is dedicated with appreciation to the men and women whose loyalty and service during times of war and peace define the character of this great nation.<br>- Dedication Plaque<br><br>This well designed and well maintained memorial park contains a UH-1 Helicopter bearing the insignia of the 1st Cavalry Division; several stone memorials bearing the names of those KIA from Fannin County; bronze sculptures and a number of historical quotes from notables ranging from Gen. Douglas MacArthur to William Shakespeare. <br><br>Made in America: For lunch or dinner, try Joes BBQ, 3365 E First St. and Blue Ridge Mountain BBQ, 3870 E First St., both just a block or so from the Fannin County Veterans Memorial.<br><br>Some of the best motorcycling roads in Georgia are nearby. For riders not familiar with the area, one suggestion is to follow Old Hwy 76 east towards Morganton, Georgia, and then take Hwy 60 to Dahlonega, by way of Sucches, Georgia (about 45 miles Morganton-Dahlonega). HWY 60 IS ONE OF THE BEST ROADS IN NORTH GEORGIA. <br><br>Another suggestion is ride east to Blairsville and then take Hwy 129 south. About 10 miles south of Blairsville take Hwy 180 southwesterly towards Sucches and then on to Dahlonega. Georgia Hwy 180 rivals the nationally-known motorcycle road, "The Dragon" in curves and technical riding. With neither the hype nor the sometimes frenzied "racers" plying "The Dragon," Hwy 180 is in many ways a superior ride, according to the state sponsor.]]></description>

Scorers have final say whether standards are met.<br> <br>On Veterans Day, November 11, 2015 the City of Alpharetta dedicated this veterans memorial, "The Defenders." This memorial dramatically features two soldiers appearing as if on patrol, on the move and in action. These soldiers are at the tip of the metaphorical spear which keeps our enemies at bay. We are indeed fortunate to have these soldiers and our military "defending" our freedoms and our safety. Without them, we would not be free and we would not be safe. <br><br>The memorial is located at the back of the City Hall complex along a beautiful and lushly landscaped flowing stream. Congratulations and thank you to the City of Alpharetta for dedicating "The Defenders" memorial!<br><br>Made in America: Across the street from City Hall try Smokejack BBQ, 29 S. Main St. Smokejack is a little more upscale than your typical BBQ joint and the food is great. Try the Burnt Ends for lunch or dinner. <br><br>Also nearby, if you're in the mood for Mexican, about two blocks away is Pure Taqueria, 103 Roswell St. This always popular restaurant serves a more authentic style of Mexican food than your typical Tex Mex joint.]]></description>

It was dedicated on Veterans Day, 2008.<br><br>Standing before the Veterans Wall of Honor one is struck by the beauty of not only the wall and memorial, but also of the entire scene, especially when visited in the early morning or late afternoon hours when the sun is low and the light golden.

The wall from left to right contains etched scenes of major wars and battles beginning with the Revolutionary War all the way to the Iraq and Afghanistan. Each section of the wall contains a quote such as the one above along with the etched scenes.<br><br>Opposite the Veterans Wall is the POW/MIA tribute. "A more intimate and quiet setting, the POW/MIA tribute allows for reflection and remembrance. [The POW/MIA tribute] stands where it does to commemorate those who were captured and have returned, and to symbolize those who have been lost in action serving our military, yet who remain in the memories of their families and comrades".

Scorers have final say whether standards are met.<br><br>The St. Simons Lighthouse and adjoining museum pay a fitting tribute to the light keepers who faithfully guided mariners for nearly 150 years on St. Simons Island. <br><br>For a 143 years, beginning 1810 when the first light house was built on the southern tip of St. Simons Island, light keepers kept watch and the light burning to guide shipping into the St. Simons Sound. During the Civil War with US Naval forces blockaded the southern coast. The Confederate government destroyed the original lighthouse in 1862 to prevent it from falling into Union hands during a Union raid. The current lighthouse and keepers cottage were built after the Civil War in 1872. According to Wikipedia, the Lighthouse is reputed to be haunted by the ghost of light keeper Frederick Osborne, who was killed in a duel with assistant keeper John Stephens in early March 1880. <br><br>The St. Simons Lighthouse is still fully operational, though without the light house keeper, as the lighthouse was fully automated in 1953. The lighthouse is now part of a navigational range consisting of two range lights and the lighthouse. By keeping the lighthouse between the two range lights mariners know they are in the channel leading into the St. Simons Sound.<br><br>Made in America: Visit The Lighthouse Museum, located next to the lighthouse. Climb the steps to the top of the lighthouse for a terrific view of St. Simons. http://saintsimonslighthouse.org<br><br>For BBQ, located at the intersection of two of St. Simons' main roads, BBQ lovers won't go wrong with Southern Soul Barbeque, 2020 Demere Rd.

Highway 17 is a scenic and interesting alternative to Interstate 95. The northern portion of Highway 17 travels through small towns and farmlands while the southern portion travels through the salt marshes. <br><br>Darien, Georgia is a nice stopping point along Highway 17 for breakfast, lunch or dinner.

Refer to RULES 5-7 (http://www.tourofhonor.com/pages/rules.html#rules57) for photo verification. Scorers have final say whether standards are met. <br><br>On December 7, 1941, during a surprise attack by the Imperial Japanese Navy, four of the eight largest U.S. naval battleships were sunk in Pearl Harbor. The other four suffered major damage. Eight other naval vessels were sunk or badly damaged. 188 aircraft were destroyed at nearby airfields. 2,402 people died, 1,247 were wounded.<br><br>Two of the battleships, one being the USS Arizona, still lies on the bottom along with the 1,177 bodies of sailors caught below deck that day.<br><br>In spite of all what’s written about Pearl Harbor, nothing comes close to a visit in person to this world-renowned memorial and Hawaii’s largest tourist attraction. Anyone with the slightest interest in military history should make a trip here at least once.<br><br>Pick up a free ticket and then board a Navy tender that ferries visitors to the monument straddling the USS Arizona. Once there, visitors are free to walk about, take in the exhibits, smell the still-leaking fuel after 65 years and talk with the docents. One elderly docent claims, “It’s the best job I’ve ever had and I don’t get paid for it.”<br><br>One story is about what happens when a Pearl Harbor survivor passes away. The family is given the option of a military ceremony on the memorial complete with 21-gun salute. If the honoree was cremated, a team of two Navy divers hold the urn aloft for a last chance for the family to see it, then dives down to place it into the ship’s hold, a permanent resting place alongside his comrades. Ask the docents about the baby's ashes interred on the nearby USS Utah. Or about the outdated anti-aircraft guns that caused many civilian casualties. So many stories...<br><br>Get there early because the tours fill up fast. Also includes an excellent video program on the events leading up to December 7 and how the surprise attack shook America to it’s core. An auditory tour is available, narrated by Ernest Borgnine. Removal of hats is advised on the memorial site.<br><br>Made in America: One can spend hours in the gift shop itself, or visit the many outdoor exhibits around the nearby USS Bowfin Submarine Museum. http://www.bowfin.org/museum<br><br>Nearby is a memorial with 52 plaques honoring the downed submarines from World War II, and the names of each of the submariners. <br><br>Outdoor exhibits include examples of torpedoes used in the war, including steam-driven, electric, harpoon and missile-torpedos.]]></description>

Without any city lights to guide them, one of the planes, a B-17 “Flying Fortress,” crashed into a mountain near here.<br><br>Before that, the spot was known for a 1795 battle where King Kamehameha, using European weaponry, drove defending warriors over the cliff, ending a long conflict and unifying the Hawaiian islands under one rule.

Refer to RULES 5-7 (http://www.tourofhonor.com/pages/rules.html#rules57) for photo verification. Scorers have final say whether standards are met. <br><br>This ancient warrior cemetery, located in a volcanic crater overlooking Honolulu, was once the site of secret royal burials and where offenders of polynesian taboos were sacrificed. It is now the resting place of some 33,230 U.S. military veterans, many in unmarked graves dated December 7, 1941.<br><br>The Honolulu Memorial is built high on a wall of the crater and overlooks the cemetery, consisting of several elements. A wide staircase extends from the floor of the crater to the “Court of Honor.” Flanked on both sides of the staircase are ten “Courts of the Missing” that include 28,778 etched names of soldiers MIA from World War II, the Korean Conflict and the Vietnam War. At the base of the staircase is the following inscription: “IN THESE GARDENS ARE RECORDED THE NAMES OF AMERICANS WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES IN SERVICE TO THEIR COUNTRY AND WHOSE EARTHLY RESTING PLACE IS KNOWN ONLY TO GOD.”<br><br>From the Court of Honor rises Columbia, a 30’ tall female figure, symbolizing the figurehead on the bow of a naval vessel. Beneath her is the inscription, “THE SOLEMN PRIDE THAT MUST BE YOURS TO HAVE LAID SO COSTLY A SACRIFICE UPON THE ALTAR OF FREEDOM.” Those were the words of Abraham Lincoln told to a mother of five sons lost in the Civil War.<br><br>Directly behind Columbia is a nondenominational chapel, open to the public at all times. On both sides of the chapel are 12 stunning map panels, representing ten of the major Pacific Theatre battles during World War II, plus one for the Korean Conflict and another for the Vietnam War. Each panel measures approximately 4’ wide and 10’ tall and is made of tile mosaics and crushed glass. Alongside the panels are etched marble history lessons. Brigadier General Jerome Hagen (USMC-Ret.), who teaches military history at the nearby Hawaii Pacific University, brings students here for lectures.<br><br>If all that isn’t enough, take a walk up a nearby path to an overlook of Pearl Harbor, Honolulu, Waikiki and Diamond Head. The path is lined with dozens of plaques, each one dedicated to different branches of service, war engagements and fighting groups.<br><br>Made in America: Visit the Rainbow Drive-In, home of the original "plate lunch." The founder was Seiju Ifuku, who learned to cook while in the famous 100th Battalion. He served in many campaigns in Italy and France during World War II. http://rainbowdrivein.com]]></description>

Scorers have final say whether standards are met. <br><br>This memorial honors four different regiments comprised totally of Japanese-Americans, who fought for the U.S. in World War II. The idea for the monument was conceived by a University of Hawaii professor after interviewing soldiers who helped liberate the Dauchau Death March and several concentration camps in Germany.<br><br>That would have been the 442nd Regimental Combat Team. Other regiments mentioned are the 100th Infantry Battalion, named the “Purple Heart Battalion” because of the number of casualties suffered in Europe, including those in the battle to rescue the “Texas Battalion”; the Military Intelligence Service who performed intelligence and counter-intelligence missions against the Japanese; and the 1399th Engineer Construction Battalion that earned the Meritorious Service Award for completing 54 major defense construction projects on Oahu. General Macarthur twice requested the 1399th be assigned to the Philippines, but the War Department rejected those requests, refusing to put them in direct contact with the Japanese enemy.<br><br>Also check out the memorial to fallen Maoli Warriors in nearby Fort DeRussy Park, one block towards the beach. Fort DeRussy Park is also home to the Hawaii Army Museum, housed in what used to be a bastion built to protect the island from invading forces. http://www.hiarmymuseumsoc.org<br><br>Two blocks north of here is Cruzin Hawaii Motorcycle Rental. http://cruzinhawaii.com]]></description>

More....<br><br>On June 24, 2011 Delmar celebrated the dedication of its Veterans' Memorial, created to honor those in this area who have served in all facets of military life. Men and women from Delmar and the surrounding area have served from the time of the Black Hawk Indian War to the current involvement in Afghanistan.<br><br>Made in America: The vast majority of Iowa towns' center of activity is built around railroads where people and agricultural output moved in and out of the area. Delmar had both, but perhaps one people aspect was unique. If you stop by the old train depot, which is close to the Veterans' Memorial, you'll find a small military museum and mural.<br><br>The mural commemorates Delmar as a stop for the Orphan Train between 1853 and 1939. Developed by the Children's Aid Society as part of their mission to care for homeless children on the streets of New York, they began the "free-home-placing-out" of over 120,000 children. In groups of 10 to 40, children and caretakers traveled on trains to selected spots, where children were taken in by local families. It was a social experiment that led to many success stories of those escaping a lifetime of suffering.]]></description>

In 1765, the Acadians (Cajuns) arrived in the Opelousas area and the Spanish established a garrison here in the mid-18th century. A strong Creole influence can still be felt in this old city. The cultural mosaic here produced the exotic and sought after Cajun and Creole dishes like etouffee’, jambalaya, boudin and cracklins. You can dine where world-famous chefs Paul Prudhomme, Tony Chachere and Eula Savoie honed their culinary skills.

They strive to preserve the Cajun heritage, which includes knowing how to have a good time.<br><br>For a classic Po-Boy sandwich, try the Olde Tyme Grocery just north of the memorial, at 218 West Saint Mary Boulevard. http://www.oldetymegrocery.com And get a Snowball for dessert.]]></description>

It gives the citizens of Louisiana a place to honor these firefighters and inspire young men and women to follow in their brave footsteps. The memorial consists of four main areas: The Roll of Honor - A granite wall listing all known firefighters who have perished in the line of duty; Firefighter Statue - A bronze statue of a firefighter on a knee as a symbol of remembrance; Fire Engine Bell - A brass bell from an cart drawn fire wagon is used in the dedication and memorial ceremonies; and a new monument honoring industrial firefighters.<br><br>Made in America: A visit to Baton Rouge gives one the opportunity to experience all the things to do in the capital city. From a hot culinary scene to live music, Baton Rouge offers a unique Louisiana experience. Politics is deeply entwined in the culture of Baton Rouge; it can be found both in the storied past of local dealmakers, showcased at the Old Louisiana State Capitol, and in the political history that is being written now inside the art deco skyscraper that serves as the current capitol. As home to the main campus of Louisiana State University and several smaller colleges, the city buzzes with the energy of youth while holding fast to its traditions in Southern lifestyle and historic sites.]]></description>

The Crescent City has suffered plagues, wars, imperial regime changes and devastating floods. Yet, it always wakes up with a smile on its face. This may be because its inhabitants step to an easy beat first laid down three centuries ago. Moving at this relaxed pace, visitors are delighted by the French Creole elegance of the Vieux Carre (French Quarter) or the opulence discovered in a streetcar ride through the Garden District and Uptown. Where else is there year round live music, amazing Creole and Cajun cuisine, fresh seafood, farmers markets, shopping, nightlife and more?]]></description>

Fifty-two members of the department have affirmed that oath with their lives. Our fathers, brothers, sons, wives, daughters, friends and colleagues, they were, and remain, our heroes. We owe it to them to cherish the memory of their lives and to validate the purpose of their ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. Their last full measure of devotion to the honor and traditions of the Michigan State Police must continue to teach and inspire future generations.”<br><br>Made in America: In the palm of the “hand” that makes up most of Michigan, Lansing is home to a diverse dining landscape. Among the notable places are Good Truckin’ Diner at 1107 S Washington Rd., and Capital City BBQ at 1026 W Saginaw: BBQ with a Vietnamese twist!]]></description>

Refer to RULES 5-7 (http://www.tourofhonor.com/pages/rules.html#rules57) for photo verification. Scorers have final say whether standards are met. <br><br>Standing sentinel in the middle of the town green (the only colonial county seat in New Jersey with its court house still on the original site facing its green) is the Sussex County Veterans Memorial bell tower. This memorial is dedicated to “all veterans, past, present and future,” and is surrounded by gardens for each branch of the Armed Forces including the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corp, Merchant Marine and Coast Guard. Each garden plot features a stone block with the seal or flag of each branch of the service. The plantings are individually selected to match the colors of the flags and invite you to reflect on the sacrifices made by so many veterans and their families.<br><br>Made in America: The other end of the green on Main Street hosts Narin Thai (http://www.narinthainj.com/), a funky little Thai fusion restaurant with consistently good Asian fare. Hayek’s Market (http://www.hayeksmarket.com/) just around the corner can resupply your travel foodstuffs or grab an ice cream at the walk-up counter. Jersey Dog (http://www.jersey-dog.com/) down the street has a special deep fried hot dog you won’t regret trying (add chili & cheese!). If you’re heading to the Pennsylvania Tour sites, take a ride through the nearby Delaware Water Gap and cross at Dingmans Bridge (http://dcdbc.com/history.php); it will cost you a dollar given to the collector standing in the middle of the roadway (with a barrel fire in cold weather). It’s one of the last privately owned toll bridges in the country.]]></description>

Scorers have final say whether standards are met. <br><br>Located in Barnegat Lighthouse State Park on the Jersey shore is a memorial to the U.S. Merchant Marine of WW II. The Merchant Marine were an auxiliary force in the war supplying transport of men and materials on private ships. The ships were crewed by private sailors, Merchant Mariners and members of the Navy Armed Guard. <br><br>Although not official naval vessels, they suffered losses in disproportionate numbers to the regular Navy as they often traveled alone or in small convoys without the support of carrier or battleship groups to provide protection. Their missions relied more on sheer number of vessels scattered across the ocean and their perceived lower strategic value as targets. However, the number of troops and supplies they were able to transport would not have been possible using just naval vessels. Attacked by enemy submarines, more than 800 merchant marine ships were lost at sea and became “steel coffins” for the men sent to watery graves. As the monument notes, the ocean is their cemetery.<br><br>Park in the lot off Broadway and walk the short distance to the memorial just to the right of the Interpretive Center at the end of the paved portion of the trail.<br><br>Made in America: The Dairy Queen features classic DQ ice cream as well as brazier food. A stone’s throw away on 4th, the Inlet Deli (https://www.facebook.com/inletdeli/) is open early for breakfast and into the afternoon. Bagels are brought in from NYC daily and the subs are a cut above the chain shops.]]></description>

Scorers have final say whether standards are met. <br><br>Perched on the grounds of the Millville Army Airfield Museum where Millville Airport was dedicated as the country’s first Defense Airport in 1941, a Navy A-4F Skyhawk carries on this field’s link to America’s air power. The Air Field was originally home to trainers for the P47 Thunderbolt – training over 1,500 pilots during WWII with the air museum paying homage to their service.<br><br>This Skyhawk carries on this tradition of honor having served as an active combat aircraft during the Vietnam War. It served on the USS Oriskany & USS Hancock aircraft carriers in Southeast Asia over the course of five years. The plane’s unique “hump” on the top of its fuselage was put there to house electronic countermeasures needed due to anti-aircraft missile batteries it faced in North Vietnam. <br><br>The Skyhawk stands in tribute to the flyers who braved combat dangers in Vietnam. Those serving on this particular plane returned safely. Others were not as lucky and are remembered in the museum’s exhibits – including the 14 Millville pilots who never returned. <br><br>Made in America: Although small, the Museum (http://www.p47millville.org/) is housed in the former Army Headquarters building. Grab a growler to go at the nearby Glasstown Brewing Company (http://www.glasstownbrewingcompany.com/) or check out the action at the NJ Motosports Park (http://www.njmp.com/).

Scorers have final say whether standards are met. <br><br>Tucked away on a tiny island in Constitution Gardens Pond is a memorial overshadowed by the Lincoln Memorial to the west and nearby Vietnam Memorial. Most visitors to this end of the National Mall pass by between the pond and the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool never knowing that this memorial sits as testament to the 56 Signers of the Declaration of Independence. Those men who risked their honor, fortunes and very lives are remembered through their signatures, home and occupation on 56 stones. Without them, the country and world itself would likely have been a very different place.<br><br>To get here, after visiting the Vietnam Memorial continue towards the WWII Memorial at the east end of the reflecting pool but stay on the pathways in the trees (there’s a convenient, clean and relatively unused public restroom on the way – another hidden secret) until you come upon the path and bridge that takes you to the memorial. Consider for a bit what these merchants, journalists, lawyers and politicians risked.<br><br>Made in America: Monuments and memorials abound in Washington DC but visits to the Smithsonian Museums (http://www.si.edu/) on the National Mall should not be missed. The National Zoo (http://nationalzoo.si.edu/) and the Kennedy Center’s Millennium Stage (http://www.kennedy-center.org/programs/millennium/?) with free concerts at 6pm; offer entertaining respite from hours of educational immersion at the museums.]]></description>

They were the again the first division to be deployed in WWII and only returned to the US in 1955 after serving as occupationary forces in Germany and supporting NATO. In Vietnam, the First was again first deployed, returning home in 1970. <br><br>In the Gulf War, they led the armored assault on Iraq in 1991 and four days later oversaw the surrender of the Revolutionary Guard.

It has been updated with plaques recognizing the 3 servicemen from Seaford who were killed in Iraq.<br><br>The annual Seaford Veterans Day Ceremony is held in the park with a salute and recognition of all veterans as well as any Gold Star Mothers who attend. Personal memorials are found inscribed in the bricks in the walkway that surround the memorial.<br><br>Made in America: The nearby Merci Boxcar (http://mercitrain.org/Delaware/) honors Americans who donated to the reconstruction of Europe after WWII. The Governor Ross Museum (http://www.seafordhistoricalsociety.com/index.cfm?ref=42198) features an Italian villa styled mansion on a 20 acre plantation and is fun for historians of early American history. Sal’s Italian on West Stein is the local place for pizza. But, Hard to Handle Sub Shop (https://www.facebook.com/hardtohandlesubs) on High St. is the place for mammoth tasty subs!]]></description>

Acting as honor guard for the flagpoles, stands a monument to the “unknown veterans who gave their all”. <br><br>Behind this stands a gazebo sheltering memorials to Thurmont District’s honored war dead from the World War, WWII, Korean War, the Vietnam War and to the three men killed in “conflicts after May 7, 1975.”<br><br>Also featured are massive blocks memorializing the service of residents whose names are inscribed on bronze plaques or etched into granite. The last of these pays tribute to those who served in Lebanon, Grenada, Panama, the Gulf War, Afghanistan and Iraq. Together they recognize those who served and those who died for the cause of liberty, justice and democracy. <br><br>Made in America: Nearby Catoctin Mountain Park features great twisty roads for riding, and a retreat for the President – Camp David.

Raised in memory of ten men from Talbot County who fought and died in the Vietnam War. Dedicated to “those who have fallen, those who continue to fight.” Although the memorial lists the dates of the war as 1960 – 1973, the war is traditionally dated from 1955 – 1975. In 1960 though, North Vietnam formally called for the “liberation of the south from American imperialism” and our role escalated from our advisor status. Although America’s direct military involvement ended in 1973, it wasn’t until 1975 when Saigon fell that the war finally ended.<br><br>The right hand stone features a carving of a soldier with his dying compatriot in his arms with this inscription:<br>"A last moment for friends<br>If you forget my death then I have died in vain."<br><br>Made in America: Head south across the river to Cambridge and visit the Harriett Tubman Museum (http://www.harriettubmanbyway.org/) on Race St., along with the Richardson Maritime Museum (http://www.richardsonmuseum.org/) on High St. offering a glimpse into the history of this region. After your visit to the Maritime Museum you have to stop in across the street at Jimmy & Sooks (http://jimmieandsooks.com/) for the freshest Maryland seafood (or a burger for those so inclined).]]></description>

This building is the only remaining USO constructed especially for African American soldiers in public use in the United States.<br><br>Beginning with the Buffalo Soldiers of the post–Civil War era through the modern-day conflicts of Desert Storm and Operation Iraqi Freedom, the museum bears witness to the service and sacrifice of the African American soldier. Hundreds of artifacts, photos and unique displays, including one of the most complete sets of authentic Spanish-American War medals, fill the restored main hall. Each item tells a story of pioneers such as Hattiesburg's own Jesse L. Brown, America's first black naval aviator, and lesser-known heroes such as Ruth Bailey Earl, also of Hattiesburg, whose image and actions represented the more than 500 black nurses who served during World War II. <br><br>If open, take a tour and pay tribute to the brave men and women that fought not only for our country but against prejudice and discrimination at the same time. Museum hours are 10AM-4PM Wed-Fri and 12PM-4PM Sat.]]></description>

The 608-foot, 10,000-ton vessel, known by her 1,200 officers and crew as "The Busy Bee," earned nine battle stars during her service from January 1944 to May 1945. It was during that period that the Biloxi completed one of the longest continuous tours of combat duty by any U.S. warship, never missing a major operation in the Pacific. Operating in support of carriers making air strikes against the very heart of the enemy homeland, Tokyo itself, the Biloxi saw action in battles at Okinawa, Iwo Jima, Formosa, Leyte Gulf, Saipan, the Philippines, and was one of the first ships to evacuate allied prisoners of war from Nagasaki, Japan shortly after the atomic bomb was dropped.]]></description>

When the city was forming, the U.S. Post Office approved all new town names. The city wanted to be named Excelsior. The Post Office wrote back, too close to the previously named Excelsior Springs, and asked for a second choice. The City Fathers said they didn’t care, but make it something peculiar.

Scorers have final say whether standards are met.<br><br>The Teton County Veteran Memorial was dedicated by the American Legion Post 80 on Memorial Day 2014. The centerpiece of the memorial is a pentagon pedestal of black granite with each wall bearing the emblems of each branch of service. Two walls on either side hold 144 black granite tiles with the names of Service men and women from or with a connection to Teton County, both living and dead. The bronze sculpture on the center pedestal is “Wings of Honor” by Fairfield artist Diane Hausmann. The sculpture is of two hands, representing the sacrifices of our men and women for our country, releasing five doves, one for each branch of the service as symbols of peace. <br><br>Made in America: Fairfield is a small town of 700 residents on the flat-lands of Montana. The claim to fame of the town is "Malting Barley Capital of the World" with approximately 140,000 acres of the crop in the immediate area. Nearby Freezout Lake, where as many as 300,000 snow geese and 10,000 tundra swans gather in March on their annual migratory route, is just one of the area attractions. With easy access to Glacier National Park, Lewis and Clark National Forest, and the Bob Marshall Wilderness, Fairfield is a great stop for those travelling from the center of the state with a destination to explore some of Montana’s majestic beauty in the west.]]></description>

Refer to RULES 5-7 (http://www.tourofhonor.com/pages/rules.html#rules57) for photo verification. Scorers have final say whether standards are met.<br><br>This multi service memorial at the rest stop on the east side US Highway 89 consists of three painted flags mounted on wooden posts, the US Flag, a POW/MIA flag and the Montana State Flag. A sign in front has symbols of the five branches of service for which names of veterans are listed plus the POW/MIA symbol. The inscription reads: “Honoring all our brothers and sisters who have served, are serving or will serve in the defense of our Nation.” The memorial also lists 109 names of service members, while not specified, it appears that the names listed are/were probably Park County residents. <br><br>Made in America: Follow Hwy. 89 south along the Yellowstone River and you’ll reach Gardiner, Montana at the north entrance of Yellowstone National Park and at the junction of the Gardner and Yellowstone Rivers. Officially the north entrance to Yellowstone and home to the historic Roosevelt Arch. The arch’s cornerstone was placed by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1903. The top of the arch is inscribed with a quote from the Organic Act of 1872, the legislation which created Yellowstone, which reads "For the Benefit and Enjoyment of the People." <br><br>Gardiner has a number of shops and restaurants that are quaint and very good. If you are staying the night, check out the Riverside Cottages. http://www.riversidecottages.com If you decide to into to the park, watch out for wildlife crossing (it’s all fun and games until there’s a buffalo strike) or even standing in the road. If you plan on riding through the park at elevations you could find snow into late June.]]></description>

It was settled by a group of Irish Catholic immigrants and named after Bishop John Lancaster Spalding when it was incorporated in 1875. In 1882 a little church was cut and framed in Chicago, shipped by rail to Albion and hauled the rest of the way by teams and wagons. The new church was named "St.Michael's" to honor Michael Sullivan, who had befriended many weary settlers as they walked from the rail line. <br><br>Made in America: The early owners of the local flour mill wired a turbine generator to the milling wheel and were able to generate electricity for the mill and their home, being the first residents of the county with electricity. They went on to wire the village for electricity and with some added improvements at the mill were able to provide electrical service to the residents by 1911. The mill was purchased by the town and became the municipal electric company for Spalding.]]></description>

Scorers have final say whether standards are met.<br><br>A monument to those that make America the most powerful nation in the world, the Strategic Air Command (SAC), at it’s peak, was a global force utilizing long and short range bombers as well as nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) to aid in the deterrence of aggression against the United States and Allies. SAC began during World War II as a way to coordinate the heavy bombing and reconnaissance of targets in Germany. The Air Force became an independent branch of the military in 1947 and SAC continued to grow flying various missions during the Korean War, Vietnam and Desert Storm. <br><br>In 1949, after moving headquarters to Offut Air Base in Nebraska the primary mission of SAC became damaging or destroying the Soviet Union’s ability to deliver nuclear weapons and stop Soviet advances into Western Europe. To achieve this objective SAC began the use of ICBM’s, stationed throughout the United States and Europe, the first going online March 18, 1960. The ICBM’s in their various forms remained on 24 hour standby until September 27, 1991 when they were taken off of alert status (along with the bomber crews) marking the end of the Cold War. In 1992 the assets of SAC were transferred to other active Air Force commands and Strategic Air Command was no longer an active part of the Air Force. <br><br>The Strategic Air Command Museum started in 1959 at a hangar at Offut Air Base to commemorate the contributions of the personnel of SAC. On May 16, 1998 the museum moved to it’s current location offering a 300, 00 square foot building displaying various aircraft that contributed to the mission of SAC over the years. There are also some ICBM’s on display in front of the museum. Hours of operation vary and there is a cost to enter the museum, see their website http://www.sasmuseum.com]]></description>

He saw the tourist potential of what had been the town of South Pointe along the Colorado River. It was never his intention to name the area after himself, but the post office had other ideas.<br><br>Today, Laughlin is the third most visited casino and resort destination in Nevada after Las Vegas and Reno. Laughlin has two points of access to Arizona. There is a bridge that enters the reservation land south of town, near the Avi Casino and the bridge next to this memorial, which was built by Don Laughlin.<br><br>Also next to the memorial is a boat ramp used by thousands every year to play on the Colorado River.<br><br>Laughlin is a busy town periodically throughout much of the year. One of the busiest weekends in 2016 will be April 27-30 for the Laughlin River Run, right up there with Sturgis, Daytona, Laconia, Street Vibrations, etc. Most of the casinos will not allow colors during the rally and if you plan to stay anywhere in the area you will need to make plans well in advance.<br><br>Cross the bridge into Arizona and turn left. After just a short 21 mile ride you will arrive at an another TOH site, an excellent submarine memorial at the VFW Lodge in Golden Valley, Arizona.]]></description>

Scorers have final say whether standards are met. <br><br>Located in a small green in this rural little town, this black granite slab contains an honor roll of all of the residents of Franklin who served in WWII. With names of 126 veterans inscribed on the stone, it’s hard to imagine the impact the war had on this tiny town, as the population was only 742 in 1940, and 709 ten years later. Of the 126 who went off to war, the National Archives reports that 56 never returned – killed in action or listed as missing. <br><br>Take a moment to sit on one of the stone benches flanking the memorial and consider what your town would be like, your friends, your family, if one of every six residents went off to fight a war and half of those didn’t return. It was a different world then.<br><br>Made in America: If you’re visiting before 1pm, stop at the Franklin Trading Post in the Citgo Gas Station at 33 Blackswoods Rd. This is the kind of small town breakfast and lunch place where they won’t know your name when you come in but they will before you leave. Try the blueberry pancake plate, a 10” pancake made with fresh Maine blueberries, or a crab omelet. “Cheap, good food.”]]></description>

Scorers have final say whether standards are met. <br><br>Standing on the front lawn of the Maine Statehouse, the Maine Vietnam Veterans Memorial is a group of sharp-edged concrete and steel memorial walls featuring a cut out tableau of two soldiers carrying their wounded compatriot home. A “statue in reverse” walking through the memorial you become one of those to whom this memorial was dedicated – those who served in Vietnam and those whose lives were touched by the war.<br><br>None of the 343 Maine residents who died, or the 17 still listed as Missing in Action, are recorded on the walls of the memorial despite continued public debate. The original intent to honor everyone affected by the war instead of the more traditional roll call of the dead has been questioned by some while staunchly defended by others. Forty years after its end, the war still evokes strong emotions.<br><br>Made in America: A visit to the Maine State Museum of Natural History (http://mainestatemuseum.org/) is worth a few hours in this “best kept secret” of the state capitol. An hour at Old Fort Western (http://www.oldfortwestern.org/) taking a guided tour of one of the oldest wooden military buildings in the country still standing will take you back to where Maine began. Or head to Union 20 miles away and the Sweetgrass Farm Winery and Distillery (http://www.sweetgrasswinery.com/) where Maine-grown fruits are used to produce wines and spirits.]]></description>

Occupying prime real estate abutting the ocean, Wells provided a fitting resting place for its citizens who live and work on these ocean waters. Of course, the town’s Veterans Memorial could only be placed in this hallowed ground.<br><br>With monuments, markers and even a cannon, the memorial was raised in memory of four town’s men who died in Vietnam as well as those who served in WWII, Korea and the “Vietnam Era.” They rest within sight of the ocean and always in front of today’s residents, lest they forget the sacrifices made in defense of the country.<br><br>Made in America: There’s the beach, there’s always a beach in Maine, but shops, museums and even a brewery are located in town. There’s the Dairy Queen near the memorial but if pizza is what you’re looking for, stop at Spiller’s Farm Store (http://www.spillersfarmstore.com/) and stock up on Maine blueberries, jams and syrups while you’re there.]]></description>

Scorers have final say whether standards are met. <br><br>Located in a small triangle park at the south end of town, the Lancaster Veterans Monument started life as a memorial to the residents who served in the New Hampshire Fighting Fifth during the Civil War. Being nothing if not thrifty, the residents of Lancaster repurposed the monument and rededicated to veterans of all wars to ensure that every veteran was recognized for their service to the country regardless of the war or conflict they served in. This sleepy little town in New Hampshire’s North Country is a reminder of the New Hampshire that people think of when they dream of the White Mountains. <br><br>A short ride up the road to Centennial Park brings you to the Fox Monument. A memorial not to the fox but to the “brave men and women who redeemed Lancaster from the wilderness” after the harsh winter of the settlement’s first year destroyed their crops and almost resulted in the abandonment of the new outpost. Let us know if you find out why the fox. <br><br>Made in America: A pint of Guiness and homemade corned beef sandwich at JL Sullivans Irish Pub on Main St. (across from Town Hall) will be just what’s needed after the long ride north. And for some old country bread and pastries, Magdalena Randall’s Polish Princess Bakery (http://polishprincessbakery.com/) fresh from her farm kitchen, and now newly located on Main St. north of the Town Hall, brings the tastes of her native Poland to Lancaster.]]></description>

It pays tribute to veterans from all five of American military service from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines as well as the United States Coast Guard.<br><br>Made in America: Two of New England’s most interesting places to visit are also in Woonsocket. The Museum of Work and Culture (http://www.rihs.org/museums/museum-of-work-and-culture) on Main Street, is all about the people who moved to this area in the late 19th century to work in Rhode Island’s mills. <br><br>If you’re interested in something completely different, try Chan’s (http://www.chanseggrollsandjazz.com/) which is not your typical Chinese food place.

Engraved on the base are the words "This fountain commemorates the valor and victory of the colonist forefathers at Pequot Swamp."<br><br>Shortly before Mason and his forces fought the battle at Great Swamp, he led an infamous assault on the main Pequot village near Mystic killing nearly all of its residents in what has become known as the Mystic Massacre. Colonial Mystic raised a statue to Mason on their Pequot Avenue. <br><br>Fast forward 300 years and the Pequot tribe argued that the statue honoring Mason was an insult to the memory of the Pequots and should be removed.

It was constructed by the family of Dr. Victor Westphall, whose son, David, was killed in a 1968 enemy ambush in Vietnam, near Con Thien. <br><br>The memorial is not only a tribute to the 16 Marines who died in that battle, but to all members of America’s armed forces.<br><br>The Vietnam Veterans National Memorial has become a State Park that provides along with the memorial, a Visitors Center (http://www.vietnamveteransmemorial.org) that serves as a place for reunion, reflection, healing, and sharing of experiences.<br><br>There are many stories behind the building of this veterans memorial during a time when it was unpopular to do so, but Doc Westphall persevered and it was dedicated in 1971, on the third anniversary of the death of his son. <br><br>One story is about how the Peace and Brotherhood Chapel came to remain open 24 hours a day. When Doc Westphall was building the chapel, he was locking the doors at night. One morning he found a note scrawled on a piece of scrap plywood that read, “Why did you lock the doors when I needed to come in?” Since then the doors have never been locked.<br><br>The Run for the Wall (http://www.rftw.org/) motorcycle riders make Angel Fire and Vietnam Veterans Memorial State Park one of their first stops on their trip to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC. Up to 500 motorcycles visit the Memorial on Friday, the weekend before Memorial Day. <br><br>There is also a (biker-type) motorcycle rally (http://www.redriver.org/memorial-day) in the nearby town of Red River, New Mexico every Memorial Day weekend. Most of the riders visit the Memorial during the rally which up to 20,000 motorcyclists attend.]]></description>

The path to each station meanders in a snake-like pattern with a memorial for each conflict in bends of the path. The Choctaw Code Talker memorial is the first station you come to and honors the “original Code Talkers” of WWI and WWII. The subsequent stations are for WWI, WWII, Korean, Vietnam, and Gulf Wars. It is definitely worth spending more than just a few minutes here. <br><br>When the United States entered the war in 1917, Native Americans were among the soldiers. Even though they weren’t allowed to become U.S. citizens until 1924, they felt a deep patriotic duty to volunteer and serve their country.<br><br>The United States has experienced a war in every generation since Independence, and Choctaw warriors have always fought alongside American Soldiers. Fulfilling a prophecy by Pushmataha, a Choctaw chief who died in 1827, that the Choctaw “War Cry” would be heard in many foreign lands. Tribesmen volunteered for service in the Spanish-American War in 1898, World War I in 1917, and World War II in 1941 and in wars around the world since 1945. The Choctaw soldiers were distinguished in them all.<br><br>Tuskahoma is the home of the Choctaw Capitol Building that was completed in 1884. The Capitol was in use from 1884 until 1907, when the Choctaw Nation was abolished and Oklahoma became a state. After statehood the building fell into disuse and disrepair. During recent decades, however, it has achieved new life as the national museum of the successfully reconstituted Choctaw Nation. The Choctaw Nation holds its annual Labor Day festival here, attracting nationally-known country-western singers and bands, and in excess of 25,000 attendees. http://www.choctawnationculture.com/museum/choctaw-nation-capitol-museum.aspx]]></description>

Admission is FREE but hours of admission are limited so plan accordingly. The museum is open Monday through Saturday 9am-5pm and Sunday 11am-4pm. A photo of motorcycle and building exterior is required for all stops.<br><br>Take a photo similar to the one above, along with rider flag and motorcycle.

Scorers have final say whether standards are met. <br><br>Inside the Zippo Museum, this bunker is located in the middle of the museum's display honoring the veterans. World War 2 significantly impacted the small company famous for windproof and waterproof lighters. Zippo Lighters impacted many soldiers and sailors, as well as the war efforts themselves. This museum display provides a number of displays behind glass that will touch your heart – stories, news articles, advertisements. Spend a moment and take it all in.<br><br>From the Zippo website: “Beginning in 1939, World War II had a profound effect on Zippo. Upon America’s entry into the war, Zippo ceased production of lighters for consumer markets and dedicated all manufacturing to the U.S. military. The fact that millions of American military personnel carried the lighter into battle was a significant catalyst in establishing Zippo as an icon of America throughout the world. Supplying the military market resulted in full production for the plant.”<br><br>There are many stories about Zippo lighters at war. One story out of World War 2 indicates “If I were to tell you how much these Zippos are coveted at the front and the gratitude and delight with which the boys receive them, you would probably accuse me of exaggeration,” the famed war correspondent Ernie Pyle wrote in August 1944. “I truly believe that the Zippo lighter is the most coveted thing in the army.”<br><br>It is reported that the engraved Zippo played a unique role in the Vietnam War. The term “Zippo” worked its way into the war’s military lexicon. The Army’s Vietnam War flame-throwing M-67 tanks and M-132 armored personnel carriers were commonly called “Zippos” or “Zippo tracks.” The M2A1-7 portable flamethrower used in Vietnam was referred to as a “Zippo.” <br><br>Zippo lighters were apparently called upon to perform duties such as heating rations in a helmet, lighting campfires, sparking fuses for explosives, hammering nails and even signaling to fellow soldiers with the famous Zippo click. Some reports even indicate a Zippo lighter in a shirt or pants pocket saved a life or prevented a wound by deflecting enemy bullets or shrapnel. <br><br>Zippos are much more than simple metal cigarette lighters. The ubiquitous Zippo, engraved in-country, became woven into the fabric of the Vietnam War experience. These compact lighters “are the small, speaking, archeological objects that bear witness to great personal heroism, pride, and tragedy,” wrote Jim Fiorella in his photo-filled 1998 coffee-table book, The Viet Nam Zippo, 1933-1975. The lighters served as “amulets and talismans bringing the keeper invulnerability, good luck and protection against evil,” Sherry Buchanan penned in the excellent 2007 Vietnam Zippos, which examines the extensive Vietnam War Zippo collection put together by Bradford Edwards. (source: http://www.historynet.com/light-my-fire-zippos-in-vietnam.htm)<br><br>There are more stories and old advertisements online at http://www.zippo-windproof-lighter.de/blackcrackle/WWII.htm You can see some of these old ads at the museum too.<br><br>If you own a Zippo lighter, bring it along with you. There is a Zippo clinic on site should yours need service or repair. If you want to own or collect these highly sought after lighters, there are hundreds (perhaps thousands) to choose from in the store. Yours could be worth something some day.]]></description>

Note: The monument is 300 feet off the paved road. To access the memorial, ride 300 feet on a packed gravel driveway which accesses multiple memorials. Dan's memorial will be on your left, 100 feet across level mowed lawn.<br><br>Take a photo similar to the one above, along with rider flag and motorcycle. Refer to RULES 5-7 (http://www.tourofhonor.com/pages/rules.html#rules57) for photo verification. Scorers have final say whether standards are met. <br><br>Dan Arnold died in Ar Ramadi, Iraq, when his M2A2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle was attacked by enemy forces using indirect fire. He was assigned to the Army National Guard's 1st Battalion, 109th Infantry Regiment, 28th Infantry Division, New Milford, Pennsylvania. He died on September 28, 2005. His awards include the Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Army Achievement Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Non-Commissioned Officer Professional Development Ribbon, Army Service Ribbon, Iraqi Campaign Medal and Combat Infantry Badge. <br><br>Small towns all across Pennsylvania have lost young sons and daughters to the various wars around the world. Each town honors their patriots in their own special way. Each life was special. Each loss was heart breaking. Each town entered the history books as helping make America free. Monuments and memorials like this one are erected throughout Pennsylvania to honor the selfless, heroic acts carried out by loved ones. Some memorials are large, some small. Some are simple, some elegant. Some on public display, some in subdued locations. All are worth the time to visit.<br><br>Who was Danny Arnold? To many, he was unknown. To others, he was an amazing young man. At the age of 27, he was a father of two, married to his high school sweetheart since June, 2000. One person serving with Danny reports: “Danny was in the US Army Reserve in the mid to late 90's when we were in the 828th in Scranton then in Wilkes Barre in the motor pool. Danny was one of the well most rounded knowledgeable soldiers that I served with. There was hardly anything that Danny didn't do well. He could literally smoke a PT test, shoot the lights out on the rifle range, knew his CTT (common task training ) and excelled at being a mechanic in the motorpool. Even though at the time Danny was young and still making his way thru the ranks, many of us including myself came to Danny for help and/or advice. You could see that Danny was a leader, he had all the tools of being a leader and that's what made him so popular and looked up to by other enlistees in the motor pool. The most thing that made Danny special was that he always had a smile on his face and was always fun to be around. Even when things got dull or bleak, Danny was always the one you wanted to be around to help the time go by quicker. He always made for a good conversation whether it was military talk or about our civilian lives.” (source:  http://www.fallenheroesmemorial.com/oif/profiles/arnolddaniell.html)<br> <br>As you ride the highways and bi-ways, as you see memorials and monuments, remember that Freedom is their gift to you. Stop and say thanks. <br><br>Made in America: Small towns across Pennsylvania usually have a variety of dining opportunities. How much time did you set aside for "touring" the local area? What food are you in the mood for? If you're hungry, roll on into Montrose. It's a nice walkable town with a few eateries right in the heart of town on Public Avenue. Joycie's is American cuisine, the County Seat Tavern is nearby and Wilcox's Family Diner will serve up deli sandwiches. A block or two further south, OIP (Original Italian Pizza) makes pizza using homemade dough and top-notch ingredients and The White Oak Cafe sums up their cuisine as locally grown, sustainable and delicious. Eat well and eat right.]]></description>

A bronze plaque on the monument’s front (northwest) face reads, “Dedicated in honor and memory of the soldiers and sailors from Pike County, Pennsylvania, who answered our country’s call to arms in wars of our nation.” The monument also features a bronze eagle atop a small globe.<br><br>Milford is the seat of Pike County, which was formed in 1814. The country was named for Zebulon Pike, who discovered Pike’s Peak and was killed while serving as a general in the War of 1812. <br><br>Pike County is included in the New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA Metropolitan Statistical Area. So while it may give you a feeling of being a rural community, it is easily accessible to a significantly larger economic marketplace. So you can head east and be in the MSA in no time – but where's the fun motorcycle riding in that? Take Route 6 west across northern Pennsylvania and enjoy some of the best riding and most scenic country around.<br><br>Made in America: If you’re in the mood for a local's coffee shop, visit the Frisky Goat, one block north of here at 611 Broad St. A few blocks south is Fretta’s Italian Food Specialties (http://www.frettas.com), straight out of Little Italy in NYC, 223 Broad St.]]></description>

(Penn Square)<br>GPS: 40.037780, -76.305939<br>Access: 24/7 unrestricted. The monument sits in the center of Penn Square, the intersection of E. King and S. Queen Streets, so use caution. On-street parking is available nearby. Pedestrian access is available on the northeast side of the monument.<br><br>Take a photo similar to the one above, along with rider flag and motorcycle.

Scorers have final say whether standards are met. <br><br>For approximately one day in September, 1777, after Philadelphia had fallen to the British, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, served as the country's capital. The Continental Congress met in the courthouse. They elected Benjamin Franklin to negotiate a treaty with France. At the end of the day, the Congress, and thus the distinction of the US Capital, moved further west to York, Pennsylvania. <br><br>This area is steeped in US history. This memorial on the Tour of Honor is simply one point of interest to riders and history buffs alike. At the base of the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial monument is carved the inscription, "Erected by the people of Lancaster County/ To the memory of their fellow citizens who fell /in defense of the Union /in the War of the Rebellion /1861–1865". Since being first built to honor those fighting in the Civil War, additional wars have been fought and supported by Lancaster County residents so additional plaques and inscriptions have been added as this has become a memorial to all wars. <br><br>The 43 foot tall monument is topped with a statue of the “Genius of Liberty”, with sword and shield. On the base are four statues representing each of the armed forces of the time – Navy, Infantry/Army, Artillery and Calvary. <br><br>Made in America: The area's visitor's center is located on the northwest corner of Penn Square, across from the memorial. If you are interested in learning about other tourist-related points of interest, this would be the place to gather that information. The area is rich in history as well as cultural diversity. Tourists often enjoy the Amish communities in the area. So when you are out enjoying the county's rural back roads, keep an eye out for slowed traffic and Amish horse-drawn buggies.<br><br>If you want to sample authentic Pennsylvania Dutch treats like DRIED CORN, WHOOPEE PIES, SCHNITZ UND KNEPP, or SHOOFLY PIES, here’s a website to check out:  http://www.discoverlancaster.com/dining/pennsylvania-dutch-dining.asp]]></description>

Note: the memorial is approximately 200 feet from the parking lot. The paved and level pathway makes access easy. From the parking lot, walk east on the service drive. Once you pass the tennis courts on your left, turn left on the sidewalk. Ms. McCabe's memorial is straight ahead, in the corner of the lot along the fence, beside a larger WW2 memorial.<br><br>Take a photo similar to the one above, along with rider flag and motorcycle. Refer to RULES 5-7 (http://www.tourofhonor.com/pages/rules.html#rules57) for photo verification. Scorers have final say whether standards are met. <br><br>This may be one of the smallest memorials, if not thee smallest, ever to appear on the Tour of Honor, but no other memorial may make a bigger impact on your heart. A war may be fought by soldiers. And attacks may be planned and guided by Generals and their staffs. And weapons of war may be manufactured by defense contractors. But without the support of mothers across the country, could any war ever be won?<br><br>Esther McCabe had twelve children. Eleven were boys. Eleven served their country. Eleven served their country at the same time, in the same war! Here's some of her story as reported by writer Hugh Conrad, online at http://www.americainwwii.com/articles/war-mother/ :<br><br>No mother had more at stake in the war than widow Esther McCabe, whose 11 sons all served overseas. Esther McCabe had 12 children. That was a lot, even in the 1940s. But it wasn’t what really made her stand out—nor was the fact that 11 of her children were boys, or that she raised them alone. Her claim to fame was that all 11 of her sons were in the military in World War II. It didn’t take long for all of America to find out about that. <br><br>McCabe’s first public recognition as the quintessential war mother came in 1943. It came during a gathering in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to support a war bond promotion by the Blue Star Mothers of America. McCabe shocked other attendees by naming her sons in the service (10 at that time), along with their ages and locations around the world. “I insist that my sons buy bonds, and I buy them myself whenever I can, for I feel that the war will be over that much quicker if we all help in every way possible,” she said. “I always did think the Blue Star Brigade was a fine organization, doing a good job, and I wanted to join for some time, but couldn’t get away before from my chores around the home and my letter writing.”<br><br>On Mother’s Day (1944)... the War Mothers in the United States named McCabe the Nation’s Number 1 Mother. Soon afterward, another McCabe signed up for service, and his mother earned the unique distinction of having 11 sons in the war. Eight were in the army, two in the navy, and one in the merchant marine. McCabe received another award, Pennsylvania’s Number 1 War Mother, from the Pennsylvania Newspaper Publisher’s Association. <br><br>Made in America: The town of Lilly may be in what one could call a 'restaurant desert'. It's a small town of less than 1,000 residents and an economy that fondly remembers coal mining as the economic engine. So finding your meal on the road may require you to ride a bit further to soothe a rumbling tummy. South to Portage, there's the Chatter Box Cafe serving a variety of coffee and tea, freshly made baked goods, and daily lunch specials. Or go north to Cresson, and consider the Cresson Springs Family Restaurant, a diner style restaurant known for its homemade pies!]]></description>

Note: This site is quite rural. The roads are rural motorcycle riding at its best – during the daylight hours. However, there are no painted lines and roads are narrow, even though paved (tar and gravel, typical for PA back roads), so riding after dark will require extra caution. Deer are abundant in the area.<br><br>Take a photo similar to the one above, along with rider flag and motorcycle. Refer to RULES 5-7 (http://www.tourofhonor.com/pages/rules.html#rules57) for photo verification. Scorers have final say whether standards are met. <br><br>The first casualty of the Civil War from Greene County was Jesse Taylor of Jollytown. While serving with the 7th West Virginia infantry, Company F, he was killed on October 26, 1861, at a battle in Romney, West Virginia. He had turned 21 years old a month earlier.<br><br>Greene County, Pennsylvania, provided over 1,800 men for Lincoln’s army, and at least six of these men were awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. <br><br>This Civil War Memorial, consisting of a statue, a cannon, and two mortars, was erected in 1892 in his honor by his comrades who fought with him. Internet sites report that the cannon was originally at West Point and was known as Hoover's Battery. It was moved to New York Harbor to defend the Harbor during the Civil War. After the Civil War, a political group obtained the cannon from the government to use at political rallies. It somehow ended up in Greene County and was abandoned. Local veterans found the cannon in a junkyard and restored it. The cannon was again abandoned and was picked up by a local medicine show as a curiosity. After several years, veterans' organizations, headed by Colonel Charles I. Faddis, were instrumental in placing the cannon at the Jessie Taylor Memorial.<br><br>A short jaunt down the road to N39° 43.491', W80° 20.852' (approximately 1.5 miles to the west) is a highway historical marker that provides a bit more information on Jesse Taylor. It is a nice ride there, and a roadside picnic table is provided for your enjoyment. The marker's inscription reads: <br><br>The village of Hero was originally located on the land where this sign proudly stands. Today Hero is identified by a dot on most county maps. Even so the past has marked this spot sufficiently to give it a right to the title of historical. Within sight of Hero is the grave and almost within a stone's throw the birthplace of Jesse Taylor, the first soldier from Greene County PA. to die in action in the Civil War and in whose honor the village was named. A beautiful monument was erected at the nearby village of Jollytown in 1892. At the head of the little brook called Bland's Run that gurgles through the beautiful valley facing Hero on the north is to be found the cemetery and once site of Gilmore Township's first church now known as Old Mount Tabor that was built in 1818. Also north of Hero can be found the Taylor Cemetery where Jesse's grandfather and Revolutionary soldier John Taylor was laid to rest, along with Jesse Taylor and brother Thomas, and brother-in-law John T. Pogue all three Civil War soldiers of Company F. 7th Regiment West Virginia Volunteers. This land was originally called "Hubely's Delight and was purchased by John Taylor Sr. in 1806. GAR Post No. 450 and Hero Road are named in Jesse's honor. In Mount Morris, Pennsylvania a large monument was erected also honoring Jesse and his comrades of Co. F 7th WVA Volunteers. <br><br>Made in America: Greene County, Pennsylvania, is rich in coal and natural gas, driving an active natural resource extraction industry. So, be alert for convoys of large trucks on these rural back roads as you 'stretch your legs' and enjoy the twisties and sweepers.]]></description>

				<name>PA7 - Avenue of 444 Flags</name>
				<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Gh4ljmkUwmgS37llMNi3v60lobGQHr9hBb1fPNfWaOaQGaGDFUjLS9be1934BA5_INj6QkFpp3CbqayPtx3NfrWS5D9KJBwPgKPjChBMKhtA" height="200" width="auto" /><br><br>Hermitage, Pennsylvania<br>2619 East State St.<br>GPS: 41.23352, -80.461712 <br>Access: 24/7 unrestricted.<br><br>Take a photo similar to the one above, along with rider flag and motorcycle. Refer to RULES 5-7 (http://www.tourofhonor.com/pages/rules.html#rules57) for photo verification. Scorers have final say whether standards are met. <br><br>In 1980, on the 100th day of the Iranian Hostage Crisis (1979 to 1981), the owner of Hillcrest Memorial Park, Tom Flynn, directed the hoisting of 100 flags along the Avenue leading into the cemetery. One more flag was raised each day until the hostages were released on January 21, 1981. Release was obtained 444 days after they were taken and since then 444 flags have remained on display on the Avenue.<br><br>From Hillcrest's own website, here is some background on the Avenue of 444 Flags:<br>A whole generation has passed since November 4, 1979, the date on which a violent mob stormed the American Embassy in Tehran, Iran. That started what has become known as the Iranian Hostage Crisis. As the captivity of 52 Americans dragged on and on, Tom Flynn, owner of Hillcrest Memorial Park in Hermitage, Pennsylvania, felt compelled to do something significant to focus attention on that outrageous situation. He raised one American flag, surrounded by the fifty state flags, at the entrance to the Park.<br><br>When the captivity dragged on past three months with no resolution in sight, he felt compelled to do more. The community of Hermitage and beyond stood firmly with him. Wheatland Tube donated the flagpoles and the United Steelworkers International Union Local 1660 put them up along the avenue leading into the Park. On the 100th day of captivity, in a ceremony attended by a thousand patriotic citizens, Harry Matrinko, father of hostage Michael Matrinko, raised the 100th flag. The 101st day dawned without a resolution to the crisis. So another flagpole was erected to fly another flag. One more was raised every day the crisis went on past 200, 300, 400 days. Three rows of flags continued up the Avenue and around the circle that now holds the War on Terror Veterans Memorial. The last flag was raised on January 20, 1981, 444 days after the embassy had been surrendered.<br><br>The effort was successful in helping to keep the crisis in the minds of people across the country and others around the world. The growth of the Avenue was featured in national and international media. The editors of Time Magazine chose a photo of the flags as the most appropriate image for the cover of its magazine on January 26, 1981, its first issue after the hostages had been released. <br><br>Supported by the Avenue of 444 Flags Foundation, more than 18,000 replacement flags have flown along the Avenue as a reminder that freedom isn’t free, and as a tribute to all men and women who have served in the armed forces of the United States of America.<br><br>On November 11, 2012, the Avenue took on new significance with the first interment of veterans in the Cremation Garden within the flags surrounding the War on Terror Veterans Memorial. The cremated remains of any veteran who has served honorably, as well as members of their family, can now be interred in one of the most beautiful and patriotic acres in America.<br><br>Before you go, check out Hillcrest's own website to see just how involved owner Tom Flynn is with the veterans and their families. There's more to see at the Memorial Park than just the flags.  http://www.avenueofflags.com And if you have the chance to meet Tom, express what an honor it is to meet such a true patriot.<br><br>Made in America: While in the area, head over to the town of Sharon, next door, and enjoy the shoe shopping experience you won’t forget. Reyers Shoes began as a small cobbler's shop in 1886, and today encompasses over 36,000 square feet of retail space for selling just shoes. http://www.reyers.com<br><br>If shoe shopping makes you hungry, or you feel you'll need nourishment in order to make it through that large of a store, the local area boasts many eateries.]]></description>

Refer to RULES 5-7 (http://www.tourofhonor.com/pages/rules.html#rules57) for photo verification. Scorers have final say whether standards are met.<br><br>The Memorial and National Vietnam War Museum site is located on 12 acres just east of Mineral Wells TX. The site consist of 3 gardens. The Vietnam Memorial Garden contains a 300-foot long replica of the Moving Wall™, a 1/2 scale version of the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, D.C. The wall construction generally follows the techniques that John Devitt used in building the Moving Wall™. It is constructed in a forest of Arizona Cypress trees and is accessed by a path of decomposed granite. The wall is unique in a number of ways, but particularly due to its focus on the accuracy of the names on the wall. The wall is updated at least annually to ensure it stays as current as possible.<br><br><br>The Contemplation Garden contains several key attractions, including a Vietnam-era Huey mounted almost 20 feet in the air, a special set of Huey rotor blades with dedication plaques, a flag pole, a covered bench and the only replica of the Camp Holloway Memorial Wall that was located on the post in Pleiku, South Vietnam.<br><br>The Meditation Garden is built on the eastern-most, triangular-shaped portion of the museum property. It contains multiple pathways, including two unique circular labyrinths, along with more than 350 native plants selected to fit a design prepared by the Weatherford Master Gardeners. The garden also contains a gazebo, three flagpoles and seating for visitors, along with an assortment of memorial stones and metal plaques, as well as memorial bricks in the path linking the garden to the parking lot.<br><br>The Visitor Center is an artifact in its own right, but not of the Vietnam Era exactly. The Visitor Center began its life as a double-wide trailer and was stationed at George W. Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas, when he was President. The trailer was originally a 6 bedroom, 3 bath facility with 2560 square feet of space, but was not used to live in.<br><br>When President Bush came to the ranch, the white house staff made it their headquarters. All the rooms except the bathrooms, kitchen and closets were filled with electric outlets, telephones with wires and internet connection boxes. After the president left office, the trailer went into the Texas Facilities Commission Surplus Property System and was acquired by the Museum in 2010.]]></description>

Discussion started in 2009 after Veterans from the area came back from an Honor Flight to Washington DC. In 2010 after the traveling Vietnam Wall visited Ennis, and plans were put in motion to build a permanent memorial. This memorial is to shed light on the price that has been paid for our freedom.

Scorers have final say whether standards are met.<br><br>The original Nimitz Museum began in the restored Nimitz “Steamboat” Hotel in 1968. Chester Nimitz’s grandfather, a veteran of the German merchant marine, built the hotel in the 1850s and it’s where a young Chester grew up. He later attended the U.S. Naval Academy, graduating 7th out his class of 114, and went on to a distinguished career that played a major part in the allied strategy that defeated the Empire of Japan.<br><br>The Museum led to a mission to honor all of the 8,000,000 Americans who served in the war against Japan and the more than 100,000 who gave their lives, believing that the best way to honor them is to truthfully and respectfully tell the story of their struggles, their sacrifices, and their triumphs, so future generations may learn the price of freedom. <br><br>Since 1968, the Museum has expanded to occupy a six-acre campus and gained a reputation as one of the premier military museums in the nation. Over the years the Museum was upgraded and enlarged, and the campus grew to accommodate the Memorial Courtyard, the Plaza of Presidents and the Japanese Garden of Peace. They opened the expanded George H. W. Bush Gallery in 2009. The Gallery’s state-of-the-art 33,000 square foot exhibition features 40 media installations, approximately 900 artifacts in 97 climate-controlled cases, 15 macro-artifacts, and hundreds of photographs. <br><br>The price of admission is well worth the $14, or $10 for retired military with ID.]]></description>

Petty Officer Shields is buried in the nearby Gardiner Cemetery.<br><br>Citation: “For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving with United States Navy Seabee Team 1104 at Dong Xoai, Republic of Vietnam, on 10 June 1965. Although wounded when the compound of Detachment A-342, 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne), 1st Special Forces, came under intense fire from an estimated reinforced Viet Cong regiment employing machine gun, heavy weapons and small arms, Shields continued to resupply his fellow Americans with needed ammunition and to return the enemy fire for a period of approximately three hours, at which time the Viet Cong launched a massive attack at close range with flame throwers, hand grenades and small-arms fire. Wounded a second time during this attack, Shields nevertheless assisted in carrying a more critically wounded man to safety, and then resumed firing at the enemy for four more hours. When the Commander asked for a volunteer to accompany him in an attempt to knock out an enemy machine gun emplacement which was endangering the lives of all personnel in the compound because of the accuracy of its fire, Shields unhesitatingly volunteered for this extremely hazardous mission. Proceeding toward their objective with a 3.5-inch rocket launcher, they succeeded in destroying the enemy machine gun emplacement, thus undoubtedly saving the lives of many of their fellow servicemen in the compound. Shields was mortally wounded by hostile fire while returning to his defensive position. His heroic initiative and great personal valor in the face of intense enemy fire sustain and enhance the finest tradition of the United States Naval Service.”]]></description>

He was awarded the Medal of Honor by President John F. Kennedy, for conspicuous gallantry at the risk of life above and beyond the call of duty on 30 October 1944 near St. Jacques, France.<br><br>Citation: “For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at risk of life above and beyond the call of duty near St. Jacques, France. At 11:30 a.m. on 30 October 1944, after his company had lost 55 out of 88 men in an attack on an entrenched, full-strength German company of elite mountain troops, Pvt. Ross placed his light machinegun 10 yards in advance of the foremost supporting riflemen in order to absorb the initial impact of an enemy counterattack. With machinegun and small-arms fire striking the earth near him, he fired with deadly effect on the assaulting force and repelled it. Despite the hail of automatic fire and the explosion of rifle grenades within a stone's throw of his position, he continued to man his machinegun alone, holding off 6 more German attacks. When the eighth assault was launched, most of his supporting riflemen were out of ammunition. They took positions in echelon behind Pvt. Ross and crawled up, during the attack, to extract a few rounds of ammunition from his machinegun ammunition belt. Pvt. Ross fought on virtually without assistance and, despite the fact that enemy grenadiers crawled to within 4 yards of his position in an effort to kill him with handgrenades, he again directed accurate and deadly fire on the hostile force and hurled it back. After expending his last rounds, Pvt. Ross was advised to withdraw to the company command post, together with 8 surviving riflemen, but, as more ammunition was expected, he declined to do so. The Germans launched their last all-out attack, converging their fire on Pvt. Ross in a desperate attempt to destroy the machinegun which stood between them and a decisive breakthrough. As his supporting riflemen fixed bayonets for a last-ditch stand, fresh ammunition arrived and was brought to Pvt. Ross just as the advance assault elements were about to swarm over his position. He opened murderous fire on the oncoming enemy; killed 40 and wounded 10 of the attacking force; broke the assault single-handedly, and forced the Germans to withdraw. Having killed or wounded at least 58 Germans in more than 5 hours of continuous combat and saved the remnants of his company from destruction, Pvt. Ross remained at his post that night and the following day for a total of 36 hours. His actions throughout this engagement were an inspiration to his comrades and maintained the high traditions of the military service.”]]></description>

Munro was in charge of a Higgins Landing Craft evacuating 500 besieged Marines from the beaches of Guadalcanal. Near the completion of the mission, the few marines remaining on the beach were pinned down by Japanese gunfire. Munro used his boat to cover the marines’ escape. Within minutes after the last one was safe, Munro was fatally wounded. Munro's parting thoughts concerned the men he had just rescued.

Scorers have final say whether standards are met.<br><br>In Honor Of: Buffalo Soldiers' 9th and 10th Cavalry Regiments.<br><br>In 1866, following the American Civil War, Congress created six all African Army units which later merged into four (9th and 10th Cavalry - 24th and 25th Infantry Regiments). Composed of former slaves, freemen, and black Civil War veterans, these units helped settle the west by escorting and protecting settlers, cattle drives, and railroad crews during westward expansion. The 9th and 10th Cavalry Regiments also conducted campaigns against American Indian tribes on the western frontier. They fought in over 175 engagements. <br><br>Their combat prowess, bravery, tenaciousness, and appearance on the battlefield, inspired the Indians to call them "Buffalo Soldiers" symbolizing their respect for the soldiers' bravery and valor. Through the years, Buffalo Soldiers have continued to wear this name with pride. The last segregated black regiment to see combat was deactivated in 1951. <br><br>"Buffalo Soldier" has become a generic term for all African American Army soldiers and their bravery has earned them an honored place in US history.]]></description>
